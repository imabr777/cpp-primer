My code for the exercises in the C++ Primer book by Stanley B. Lippman, Josee Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo

## Description
I am currently making my way through the * C++ Primer 5th Ed. * by Lippman, Lajoie, and Moo.

I currently have one file for each section's exercises. I realize that it might be smarter to write a single file for each exercise, but I wanted to avoid having too many files.
